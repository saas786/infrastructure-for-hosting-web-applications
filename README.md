# Specialized instrastructure for web applications

This document is the result of several hundreds of real-life incidents.
`#SaaS`

My policy on providing services is to **use specialized service provides**,
not popular ones.

## WWW

ü™® The World Wide Web is part the Internet,
so we need to connect to the Internet and provide web services.

## Infrastructure

- Domain registrar
- DNS provider
- Server provider
- SSL certificate vendor
- CDN provider
- Transactional email provider
- Storage provider for backup

## Premium server provider

"Cloud" really means virtualization **and** server clusters.
Many so-called cloud providers only virtualize a single server.

1. Software defined **and** redundant network
2. Software defined **and** redundant storage
3. Software defined **and** redundant servers
    (CPU+memory) üëàüèª this is very-very hard
4. Thin thus performant virtualization layer

## OS, middleware, runtime

1. Build on Debian
2. Know each software on your server, uninstall all others
3. Keep every file on your server under control (e.g. packages, git)
4. Monitor the kernel, the filesystem and every server software
    with functional tests, not just "pings"

### Middleware

- Apache httpd
- PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)
- Redis in-memory cache
- MariaDB database

## The Web Application

Write as little code as it is possible.
Build on well-tested packages and specialized providers.

- Integrated customer relations
- Fonts
- Videos
- Maps
- HTML widgets
- Advertisement
- Visitor tracking
- Payment gateway
- Email address verification
- Authentication
- Error tracking

Run production environments without humans.
Every problem should be solvable with CI
and anonimized staging environments.

üí° Recognize your tech debt when you are manually working
on a production environment.
